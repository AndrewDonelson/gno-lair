# [Gno-CLI]

- gno.cli: Gno.lair Command Line Interface
- will allow creation of new Gno.lair projects with standard structure, configuration and listing of available packages, realms and examples on the Gno.lair website?

## Sol2Gno

Solidity to Gno transpiler. A GNO tool that will parse Solidity smart contract source code and convert it to GNO code. 

### High-level steps to achieve this goal:

1. Develop a Solidity lexer and parser in GNO: 
   - Need to create a lexer that can tokenize the Solidity source code, 
   - Need a Parser that can understand the grammar and generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of the code.
2. Create a Solidity-to-GNO converter: 
   - This component will take the AST generated by the parser and convert it into an equivalent GNO representation. 
   - It will handle the translation of data types, functions, and control structures from Solidity to GNO.
3. Generate GNO code: 
   - Once the conversion is complete, the tool will generate GNO code that can be compiled and executed.
